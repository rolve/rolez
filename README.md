# The Rolez Programming Language

*Rolez* is a research programming language that offers *deterministic parallel
programming* in a Java-like language.
This means that parallel programs written in Rolez are *guaranteed* to produce
the same results every time they are executed (they actually produce the same
results as if executed sequentially).
In particular, notorious PP problems such as data races and deadlocks are
impossible in Rolez, which makes writing parallel programs as safe as writing
sequential programs.

Rolez is based on the *Parallel Roles* programming model, which is described in
[this research paper][pr].
Until this mini-tutorial is complete, we recommend to read Sections 1&ndash;3
of the paper to understand the basics of Rolez.
For more background about deterministic parallel programming, see
[this][threads] and [this article][deterministic].


## Hello World!

Rolez is very similar to statically-typed, object-oriented languages like Java
or Scala.
The main differences all have to do with how parallelism is expressed and
controlled.
For example, there are no explicit threads in Rolez; instead, you can declare
a method as a *task*, to make it execute in parallel to the invoking code.

The execution of every Rolez program starts in the *main task*.
For example, *Hello World!* in Rolez looks like this:

<pre>
<strong>object</strong> App {
    <b>task pure</b> main: <b>void</b> {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
</pre>

Like Scala, Rolez has no static fields or methods; instead, you can define
globally accessible singleton objects, like the `App` object above.
The `System` class is a singleton object too.
The meaning of the `pure` keyword is explained later.


## Compiling and Running a Rolez Program

Rolez runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
It uses a source-to-source compiler based on [Xtext][xtext] to translate Rolez
code into Java code, which can be compiled to bytecode using a standard Java
compiler.

There are two ways to use the Rolez compiler, either from the command line,
using [Maven][mvn], or using the [Eclipse IDE][eclipse].
If you already have Maven installed on your system, using Maven is the quickest
way to try out Rolez.
Otherwise, or if you want to do more than some quick experiments, then we
recommend to use Eclipse, as the Eclipse Rolez editor gives you some nice
features, like syntax highlighting, tooltips, simple code completion, and
automatic compilation including error markers.

### Maven

Create a new Maven project and add `rolez-parent` as the parent project to your
`pom.xml` file, as follows.
This will pull in all the necessary dependencies and configuration to compile a
Rolez program.

```xml
<parent>
    <groupId>ch.trick17.rolez</groupId>
    <artifactId>rolez-parent</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</parent>
```

In addition, you need to add the Rolez Maven repository, which always contains
the most up-to-date version of the Rolez compiler and runtime library (and the
`rolez-parent` project above).

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>rolez-maven-repo</id>
        <url>https://rolve.gitlab.io/rolez/maven/</url>
        <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

Now, create an `App.rz` file in your project's `src/main/java` folder and paste
the *Hello World!* code from above. Run `mvn compile` in the project root to
compile the program and `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=App -q` to execute it.
Note that the first time you run these commands, Maven automatically downloads
the Rolez compiler and the runtime library (and many other dependencies), which
can take some time.

You can find a complete *Hello World!* Maven project, including more detailed build
instructions, in the examples directory:
[examples/helloworld](https://github.com/rolve/rolez/tree/master/examples/helloworld).

### Eclipse

To use Rolez inside Eclipse, first you need to download and install the
[Eclipse IDE for Java Developers][eclipse-java], if you haven't already.
Rolez requires at least Eclipse Photon.

You can install the Rolez SDK plugin by going to the *Help* menu and selecting
*Install New Software*.
In the field that says "type or select a site", enter the Rolez update site:

    http://rolve.gitlab.io/rolez/eclipse/

and press Enter.
Select the *Rolez SDK* item below and follow the dialog to finish the installation.

After a restart, you are ready to create a Rolez project.
In the menu, go to *File → New → Project* (**not** *Java Project*!) and then select
*Rolez → Rolez Project*.
Enter a name and press *Finish*; this will generate a Java project with Rolez support.
The project already contains a `HelloWorld.rz` file that contains a Rolez program
similar to the one above.
In addition, you will find a `src-gen` folder, which contains the Java code that is
generated from the Rolez code inside `HelloWorld.rz`.

Modify the Rolez file and save it.
If you did not introduce any compile errors, the file will be recompiled and the Java
file will be updated immediately.
You can have both the Rolez and Java file open in two editors next to each other, to
see the changes happen right away.

To execute the program, you simply open or select the generated Java file and press
the green Run button.
You should see the output of the program in the *Console* view.


## Declaring and Starting Tasks

To see how we can parallelize a program in Rolez, let's start with this simple
program that estimates π using the Monte Carlo method:

<pre>
<b>import</b> rolez.util.Random
<b>object</b> Pi {
    <b>task pure</b> main: <b>void</b> {
        <b>val</b> random = <b>new</b> Random;
        <b>val</b> n = 1000000000;
        <b>var</b> hits = 0;
        <b>for</b>(<b>var</b> i = 0; i < n ; i++) {
            <b>val</b> x = random.nextDouble;              
            <b>val</b> y = random.nextDouble;
            <b>if</b>(x*x + y*y <= 1)
                hits++;
        }
        System.out.println("π = " + hits / (0.25 * n));
    }
}
</pre>

To speed this program up on computers with multiple cores, we can wrap the main
computation into a task and start that task multiple times, making each task
perform only a part of the computation:

<pre>
<b>import</b> rolez.util.Random
<b>object</b> Pi {
    <b>task pure</b> main: <b>void</b> {
        <b>val</b> n = 1000000000;
        <b>val</b> cores = 4;
        
        <b>val</b> tasks = <b>new</b> Array[Task[<b>int</b>]](cores);
        <b>for</b>(<b>var</b> i = 0; i < cores; i++)
            tasks.set(i, <b>this start</b> simulate(n/cores));
        
        <b>var</b> totalHits = 0;
        <b>for</b>(<b>var</b> i = 0; i < cores; i++)
            totalHits += tasks.get(i).get;
        
        System.out.println("π = " + totalHits / (0.25 * n));
    }
    <b>task pure</b> simulate(n: <b>int</b>): <b>int</b> {
        <b>val</b> random = <b>new</b> Random;
        <b>var</b> hits = 0;
        <b>for</b>(<b>var</b> i = 0; i < n ; i++) {
            <b>val</b> x = random.nextDouble;              
            <b>val</b> y = random.nextDouble;
            <b>if</b>(x*x + y*y <= 1)
                hits++;
        }
        <b>return</b> hits;
    }
}
</pre>

To start a task, we use the `start` keyword instead of the dot that usually
separates the receiver from the member name (as in `System.out`).
Note that, at the moment, Rolez's syntax does not allow you to leave away
the `this` when accessing members or starting tasks with the same receiver as
the enclosing method.

A `start` expression returns an instance of the built-in `rolez.lang.Task`
class, with a type argument that corresponds to the return type of the task.
To get the result of a task, you can invoke the `get` method on the `Task`
instance, which blocks until the task has finished.

The above code uses a loop to start multiple tasks and stores all task instances
in an array.
After all tasks have been started, the main task continues to combine the
task's partial results into the final result.

You can find the complete *Pi* Maven project in the examples directory:
[examples/pi](https://github.com/rolve/rolez/tree/master/examples/pi).


## Object Sharing

*TODO*.


## Compiling the Rolez Infrastructure

*TODO*, but basically `mvn install -DskipTests` in the root directory.
